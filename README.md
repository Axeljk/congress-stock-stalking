# Congress Stock Stalking

## Description

> With great power comes great responsibility

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="assets/img/StockStalk.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the (dis)Information Age everyone appears to have skeletons, and it can be difficult to trust anyone. While the data supplied isn't perfect, the manditory stock disclosures help paint a strong picture of those representing us. By cross-referencing data from congress and stock price history, their actions are clear. More educated judgments can be made with more intimate knowledge.
